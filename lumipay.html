        <h5>01. Research</h5>
        <h3>How does it start? A payment app contains everything?</h3>
     
        <p>As a college student, I've noticed that many of my peers complain about trivial things regarding money. The one I hear the most was “why can't we have an app that contains everything so that I don't have to use separate tools to do money related things”
            This problem got me thinking, so I decided to explore what is "everything" and how we tackle it.</p>
        
        <h3>How do young people use payment app?</h3>
        <p>I conducted a <b>User interview + User survey</b>, in order to</p>
      
            <ul>
            <li>01. To better understand user behaviour around the activity of transferring and paying</li> 
            <li>02. To determine which features that users prefer to have when using a mobile payment app</li> 
            <li>03. Documenting user pain points with existing mobile payment app on the market</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b> 32 (4+28) Participants are involved</b>
            4 user interviews were conducted among young people (from age 21-30)
            28 responses were received in the user survey in total
            </p>

            </picture>
            <p>In order to identify user insights and I used Affinity Mapping for grouping and understanding information.</p>

            <h3>Insights. Everything and more</h3>
            <p>I've found that students are looking for more than just a multi-functional payment app. They are also very concerned about other aspects.</p>
            
            <div id="TwoCol">
                <div>
                    <b>Pay, but not only pay</b> <br>
                    <p>People want payment apps to be multi-functional. In addition to money transfer functions, other features such as collecting tickets, recording and categorising the spendings also important for them.
                    </p>     
                </div>
                <div>
                    <b>Safety first</b> <br>
                    <p>Users place a high priority on security. They believe that a combination of different methods of security verification will better protect their accounts.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <b>Smooth onboarding</b> <br>
                    <p>People are frustrated when they found the onboarding process is not instructive enough and collect information without a reason.
                    </p>
                </div> 
                <div>
                    <b>Simple and intuitive</b> <br>
                    <p>The prefer clean and neat interfaces with necessary functions over crowded new features.
                    </p>

         <!-- For the define part -->
        <h5>02. Define</h5> 
        <h3>Core user goals</h3>
        <p>
            Based on the pain points I get from the interviews and survey, I identified the core user goals.
           <b>Pain points → User goal</b>
        </p>

        <p>Overwhelming with crowded unnecessary features 
            <br>→ I need a well organized screen with only necessary functions.</p>
        <p>Not instructive and informative onboarding 
            <br>→ I can easily understand what the app can do and why it collects certain information</p>
        <p>Worry about the security issues 
            <br>→ I can trust the app and I feel safe everytime I use</p>

        
        <h3>Scope and features</h3>
        <h4>Multifunctional & Neat</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                A way to handle all necessary money related things. 
                A simple, intuitive and well-organized interface
                → 
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01. Transfer to bank and mobile (scan and mobile transfer)</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;02. Track spendings and history payments            </li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;03. Collect bank cards, tickets and loyalty cards</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Smooth & Safe</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                A safe way to deal with money things
                easy to get started the first time using the app
                → 
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;04. Two factor authentication</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;05. Informative and clear onboarding screens</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>User case</h3>
        <p>In order to get the solutions in the context of end users and the benefit they’ll receive. I created two user cases.
        </p>
        <h4>Case 1</h4>
        <p>As a person who is afraid of trivial things, I want a payment app with a variety of functions so that I can do money-related things in one place.</p>

        <h4>Case 2</h4>
        <p>As a safety concern user, I want to have a informative onboarding experience and a safety authentication so that I can use the app without worrying.</p>

            <h5>03. Design</h5> 
            <h3>Sketches and iterations</h3>
            <p>In order quickly document my ideas and draft my concept. I used paper and pen to make sketches to move forward.</p>

            <h3>High Fidelity prototype</h3>
            <p>After 5-6 times iterations of sketch, I turned them into aclickable prototype in order to conduct usability testing.</p>

        <div class="ContentBlock">
        <h5>04. Testing</h5>
        <h3>Prototype, test, and repeat</h3>
        <p>Moderated in-person testings were taken. The tests included a short briefing, task performance with Lumi Pay conducted on a mobile app, and a debriefing.</p>
        <p>Goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>01. Determine how easy and understandable is for participants log in/sign up on the app</li>
                <li>02. Measure if the participants can easily navigate the app to find the main functions</li>
                <li>03. Determine if the participants the learnability of the main functions</li>
            </ul>
                <ul>
                     <li>- How easy participants can complete the transfer process?</li>
                     <li>- Does the spending analysis page intuitive enough for users?</li>
                     <li>- Can participants easily check the tickets and loyalty cards?</li>
                 </ul>
        
        <p>I recruited 6 participants. They are young people age between 21-30 with the experience of using payment app and they all have the need to use secure, simple anduseful payment applications.</p>

        <h3>Testing result: Lumi Pay received love from young participants, however...</h3>
        <p>In order to organise my observation and sorted them into categories, I used the rainbow sheet, which also helps me make decisions in the following steps.
            I rated the errors by referring Jakob Nielsen's four-steps rating scale.</p>
