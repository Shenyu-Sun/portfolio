        <h2>Lumipay: A safe, fast and neat way to organise money related trivial for young people.</h2>
        <h5>00. Overview</h5>
        <h3>How does it start? A payment app contains everything?</h3>
     
        <p>As a college student, I've noticed that many of my peers complain about trivial things regarding money. The one I hear the most was “why can't we have an app that contains everything so that I don't have to use separate tools to do money related things”
            This problem got me thinking, so I decided to explore what is "everything" and how we tackle it.</p>
        
        <!-- For the research part -->
        <h5>01. Research</h5>
        <h3>How do young people use payment app?</h3>
        <p>I conducted a User interview + User survey, in order to</p>
      
            <ul>
            <li>01. To better understand user behaviour around the activity of transferring and paying</li> 
            <li>02. To determine which features that users prefer to have when using a mobile payment app</li> 
            <li>03. Documenting user pain points with existing mobile payment app on the market</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Participants  4+28 are involved</p>

            <ul>
            <li>4 user interviews were conducted among young people (from age 21-30)</li> 
            <li>28 responses were received in the user survey in total</li> 
            </ul>
             
            <p>In order to identify user insights and I used Affinity Mapping for grouping and understanding information.</p>
            <h3>Insights. Everything and more</h3>
            <p>I've found that students are looking for more than just a multi-functional payment app. They are also very concerned about other aspects.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>01. Pay, but not only pay 
                    People want payment apps to be multi-functional. In addition to payment and money transfer functions, other features such as collecting tickets, recording and categorising the spendings also important for them.
                </li>
                <li>02. Safe first
                    Users place a high priority on security. They believe that a combination of different methods of security verification will better protect their accounts.
                </li>
                <li>03. Smooth onboarding
                    People are frustrated when they found the onboarding process is not instructive enough and collect information without a reason.
                </li>
                <li>04. Simple and intuitive
                    The prefer clean and neat interfaces with necessary function over crowded new features.
                </li>
                </ul>
        
         <!-- For the define part -->
        <h5>02. Define</h5> 
        <h3>Feature prioritisation MVP</h3>
        <p>
            Based on the insights I get from the interviews and survey, I identified the features that I will incorporate in the app.
        </p>
            <h4>Pay, but not only pay</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>01. Transfer to bank and mobile</li>
                <li>02. Track spendings and history payments</li>
                <li>03. Collect bank cards</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Safe first</h4>
                <ul>
                <li>04. Two factor authentication</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Smooth onboarding</h4>
                <ul><li> 05. Informative and clear onboarding screens</li></ul>
           
        <h3>User flow - What steps user need to take to accomplish the goal?</h3>
        
        <!-- For the design part -->
        <h5>03. Design</h5> 
        <h3>Sketches and iterations</h3>
        <p>In order quickly document my ideas and draft my concept. I used paper and pen to make sketches to move forward.</p>
        <picture>
            <img class="img1" src="img/lumi/Sketch.png" alt="sketch">
        </picture>

        <h3>High Fidelity prototype</h3>
        <p>After 5-6 times iterations of sketch, I turned them into aclickable prototype in order to conduct usability testing.</p>

        <!-- For the testing part -->
        <h5>04. Testing</h5>
        <h3>Prototype, test, and repeat</h3>
        <p>Moderated in-person testings were taken. The tests included a short briefing, task performance with Lumi Pay conducted on a mobile app, and a debriefing.</p>
        <p>Goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>01. Determine how easy and understandable is for participants log in/sign up on the app</li>
                <li>02. Measure if the participants can easily navigate the app to find the main functions</li>
                <li>03. Determine if the participants the learnability of the main functions</li>
            </ul>
                <ul>
                     <li>- How easy participants can complete the transfer process?</li>
                     <li>- Does the spending analysis page intuitive enough for users?</li>
                     <li>- Can participants easily check the tickets and loyalty cards?</li>
                 </ul>
        
        <p>I recruited 6 participants. They are young people age between 21-30 with the experience of using payment app and they all have the need to use secure, simple anduseful payment applications.</p>

        <h3>Testing result: Lumi Pay received love from young participants, however...</h3>
        <p>In order to organise my observation and sorted them into categories, I used the rainbow sheet, which also helps me make decisions in the following steps.
            I rated the errors by referring Jakob Nielsen's four-steps rating scale.</p>

        <h3>3 Main Improvements</h3>
        <h4>01. More description, less unnecessary info</h4>
        <p>67% of participants did not know what is IBAN, PIN and the number on the history screens.
        <br/>33% of participants were confused with the input field when they try to fill</p>
