        <h2>Trainee at Elisa: Cross-platform unified design system, navigtaion redesign and more.</h2>
        <h5>Cross-platform unified design system</h5>
        <h3>An overview page in Figma for designers</h3>
     
        <p> During my traineeship, I contributed the design system by creating the reusable and neat components, aligning the layout across code and design, working closely with product owner, designers and developers.
        </p>
        <p> Before, the EDS contained multiple inconsistencies. 1) The designs in storybook (code infomation) and in Figma (design platform) are not aligned. 2) Components and experienmental components are scattered in design files in different places 3) Designers have trouble using the components in the right way.
        </p>
        <p> I created the <b>instance overview page</b> in Figma for all of the components so that designers can check at one glance instead of going into different pages and guess where they can find it.
       The layout is aligned with storybook and pages are coded with color for missing design.
        </p>

        <p>The new layout received really good feedback from designers and developers.</p>

        <h5>Navigation redesign (WIP)</h5>

        <h3>Unfied experience under different navigations</h3>
        <p>
            It has been years since last time design for navigations under Elisa domain. However, from <b>users' perspective</b>, they 1) Have inconsistent visual experience while navigating across different services (the layout of the interface) 2) Have problem finding the way to login and switching between different services (hard to find the way back and go forward)
        From <b>stakeholder view</b>, they wouold love to keep the unique features they have on their own navigation. </p>
        
        <p>A navigation redesign project opened inside Design System Team. We interviewed and had disccussion with over 25 people inside the company to understand the needs from different teams and limitations. In the end, we came up <b>a new design solution that minimized the impact on their team own navigation design, but at the same time, maximumed the user experience cross different services.</b></p>
